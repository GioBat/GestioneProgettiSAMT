# GestioneProgettiSAMT
## Web application for project management SAMT info

The purpose of this project is to create a site that allows management of projects in the fourth year. The site must present a list of all projects. These projects will be included by the responsible teachers. Once inserted the pupils will have the possibility to choose a project. In addition, the site will allow an administrator user to add, edit and delete teachers and pupils. Once the projects have been chosen, the site will create a playlist for presentations. Each teacher has the opportunity to fill out the evaluation form of their projects, based on the assessments will automatically calculate a project note. Using a button inserted in the evaluation table, the teacher can generate a PDF of the evaluation. The site has three different types of accesses, student, teacher, and administrator.
